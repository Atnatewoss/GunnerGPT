Under Mikel Arteta, Arsenal’s build-up play is designed to progress the ball from the defensive third into advanced zones through controlled possession, positional structure, and numerical superiority. The primary objective of the build-up phase is not speed, but stability: maintaining access to central areas while minimizing turnover risk. This approach reflects Arteta’s emphasis on structure as a prerequisite for creativity.

Arsenal typically initiate build-up from the goalkeeper using short passes rather than long clearances. The goalkeeper functions as an additional passing option, enabling the team to create a numerical advantage against the first line of opposition pressure. Centre-backs split wide to stretch the press horizontally, while a pivot midfielder or inverted full-back drops into central spaces to offer a progressive outlet. This creates a stable base shape, often resembling a 3-2 structure in the first phase of possession.

A defining feature of Arsenal’s build-up is the use of asymmetry. One full-back frequently inverts into midfield while the opposite full-back holds width or advances higher up the pitch. This allows Arsenal to maintain central compactness while still threatening wide areas. The inverted full-back contributes to ball circulation, helps resist pressing, and supports progression through the half-spaces rather than relying solely on wide channels.

Midfielders play a critical role in connecting defensive build-up to attacking phases. The deeper midfielder positions themselves between opposition lines, constantly adjusting body orientation to receive on the half-turn. This enables forward progression with minimal touches and supports quick tempo changes once central access is achieved. Rotations between midfielders are common, but they are structured rather than free-form, ensuring positional balance is preserved during circulation.

When opponents press aggressively, Arsenal’s build-up emphasizes press manipulation. The team deliberately recycles possession across the back line to draw opponents forward and destabilize their defensive shape. Once space is created, vertical passes are played through the center or diagonally into advanced midfielders or wingers positioned between the lines. This approach prioritizes breaking the press through combination play rather than bypassing it.

If central progression is blocked, Arsenal are prepared to shift the point of attack quickly. Long diagonal switches are used selectively to exploit weak-side space created by compact opposition pressing. These switches are not random but are typically triggered once Arsenal have successfully pinned opponents on one side of the pitch through sustained circulation.

Arteta’s build-up system also incorporates rest defense principles. While attacking, Arsenal maintain a stable defensive structure behind the ball, usually with three players positioned to counter potential transitions. This ensures that even during prolonged possession phases, the team is protected against counterattacks and can quickly regain control if possession is lost.

Overall, Arsenal’s build-up play under Arteta is defined by patience, positional discipline, and calculated progression. The system seeks to create high-quality attacking situations by ensuring the ball reaches advanced areas under controlled conditions, rather than through rapid or unstructured transitions. This structured approach forms the foundation upon which Arsenal’s attacking and defensive phases are built.
