The 2022–23 Premier League season represented a defining moment in Arsenal’s rebuild under Mikel Arteta. After several years of transition and structural change, the season marked Arsenal’s return to genuine title contention and signaled the effectiveness of Arteta’s long-term project. Expectations entering the campaign were centered on top-four qualification, but the team exceeded those benchmarks significantly.

Arsenal began the season with a clear tactical identity and a settled core of players. The team adopted a possession-based, proactive style focused on structured build-up, aggressive pressing, and positional discipline. This clarity allowed Arsenal to establish early momentum, consistently controlling matches and accumulating points at a title-challenging pace throughout the first half of the season.

A key feature of Arsenal’s success was the emergence and cohesion of a young core. Players such as Bukayo Saka, Martin Ødegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, and William Saliba played central roles, combining technical quality with tactical maturity. Ødegaard, appointed captain, became the team’s primary creative reference point, while Saka and Martinelli provided consistent attacking output from wide areas.

Defensively, the partnership between Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães significantly improved Arsenal’s stability. The team’s ability to defend higher up the pitch enabled more aggressive pressing and sustained attacking pressure. Arsenal conceded fewer high-quality chances compared to previous seasons, reflecting improved organization and rest defense.

Midfield balance was another critical factor. While the squad lacked depth in certain areas, the existing midfield structure allowed Arsenal to control tempo and resist opposition pressing for long stretches. However, injuries, most notably to Saliba late in the season, exposed structural fragility and impacted Arsenal’s ability to sustain performance levels during the decisive run-in.

As the season progressed into its final phase, Arsenal faced increased pressure from Manchester City, whose experience and squad depth ultimately proved decisive. Arsenal dropped points in key fixtures, and the loss of defensive stability coincided with a reduction in control during high-pressure matches. Despite leading the league for the majority of the season, Arsenal finished second, narrowly missing out on the Premier League title.

Despite the disappointment of falling short, the 2022–23 season was widely viewed as a breakthrough rather than a failure. Arsenal secured Champions League qualification for the first time since 2016 and demonstrated that their tactical model and squad profile were capable of competing at the highest level. The season validated Arteta’s emphasis on youth development, positional play, and long-term planning.

Overall, the 2022–23 campaign established Arsenal as a legitimate title contender and laid the foundation for subsequent seasons. It transformed external perceptions of the club and reinforced internal belief in the project, making it a critical reference point in understanding Arsenal’s modern era under Mikel Arteta.
