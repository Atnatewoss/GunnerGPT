The 2020–21 season represented the earliest and most unstable phase of Arsenal’s rebuild under Mikel Arteta. Having taken over midway through the previous campaign, Arteta faced the challenge of implementing a new tactical identity amid squad imbalance, limited continuity, and external disruption. The season was defined less by results and more by structural experimentation.

Tactically, Arsenal struggled for consistency. While Arteta aimed to establish a possession-oriented system with positional discipline, the squad lacked the technical and athletic balance required to execute it reliably. Build-up play was often slow and predictable, and Arsenal frequently found difficulty progressing the ball through midfield and creating chances from open play.

Defensively, Arsenal showed intermittent organization but lacked cohesion across the pitch. The team often dropped into deeper blocks to maintain compactness, limiting exposure but reducing attacking threat. This cautious approach reflected the transitional nature of the squad rather than a settled tactical identity.

The season highlighted significant squad issues. Several senior players did not fit the emerging system, while younger players had yet to fully assume leadership roles. This imbalance made sustained performance difficult and contributed to inconsistent league form.

Despite these challenges, the 2020–21 season was important in establishing foundational principles. Arteta emphasized standards, accountability, and tactical structure, even when results were unfavorable. The campaign clarified the need for extensive squad renewal and laid the groundwork for future recruitment aligned with a long-term vision.

Overall, the 2020–21 season is best understood as a reset period. While outcomes were underwhelming, the season marked the beginning of a deliberate shift away from short-term fixes toward a more coherent footballing identity.
