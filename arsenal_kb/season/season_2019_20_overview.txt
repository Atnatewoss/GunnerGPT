The 2019–20 season marked the beginning of a significant transitional period for Arsenal and the start of Mikel Arteta’s managerial tenure. The campaign was divided into two distinct phases: the early part of the season under Unai Emery, followed by Arteta’s appointment midway through the campaign.

Prior to Arteta’s arrival, Arsenal struggled with tactical clarity and consistency. Performances were characterized by defensive vulnerability, unclear pressing structures, and an absence of a coherent playing identity. These issues contributed to unstable results and highlighted deeper structural problems within the squad.

Arteta was appointed in December 2019 with a mandate focused on restoring structure, discipline, and long-term direction rather than immediate transformation. Upon taking over, his initial priority was to stabilize the team defensively and introduce basic positional principles. Arsenal often adopted a more compact shape, emphasizing organization and risk reduction over attacking fluidity.

Given the limited time and inherited squad composition, Arteta’s tactical implementation during the 2019–20 season was necessarily pragmatic. Build-up play was simplified, pressing was situational rather than aggressive, and attacking patterns were still underdeveloped. The emphasis was on establishing baseline standards and reintroducing collective responsibility.

The season served as a diagnostic period. Arteta identified mismatches between the squad and his intended playing style, clarifying the need for significant personnel changes and a longer-term rebuild. Young players were assessed, senior roles were evaluated, and foundational cultural principles were introduced.

Overall, the 2019–20 season is best understood as the starting point of Arsenal’s modern reset. While it did not feature a fully realized tactical system, it laid the groundwork for future seasons by establishing leadership, structure, and a clear strategic vision. This campaign represents the conceptual beginning of the process that would define Arsenal’s evolution in the years that followed.
