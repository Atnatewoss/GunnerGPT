In addition to Arsenal’s core tactical figures, the squad under Mikel Arteta is supported by a group of players who provide depth, flexibility, and situational adaptability across all phases of play. These players contribute to the overall system by fulfilling specialized roles rather than acting as primary structural anchors.

In goal, David Raya operates as Arsenal’s first-choice goalkeeper, selected primarily for his composure in possession and ability to participate in build-up play. His distribution allows Arsenal to initiate attacks from deep positions and maintain numerical superiority during the first phase of possession. Raya’s positioning and decision-making support a high defensive line by enabling quick recycling of possession and sweeping behind the defense when required.

Across the defensive line, Gabriel Magalhães partners William Saliba as a physically dominant and aggressive center-back. Gabriel provides strength in duels, aerial dominance, and left-sided balance, allowing Arsenal to defend assertively while maintaining build-up stability. Ben White operates primarily as a right-back or hybrid defender, offering positional intelligence, ball progression, and defensive reliability. His adaptability enables Arsenal to shift shapes fluidly during different phases of play.

Full-back depth is supplemented by players capable of both wide and inverted roles, allowing Arteta to adjust structure depending on opposition pressure. These players contribute to maintaining width, supporting midfield overloads, or reinforcing defensive compactness as required.

In midfield, Arsenal rely on a combination of technical security and tactical discipline beyond their primary starters. Players such as Leandro Trossard provide versatility, capable of operating in midfield or attacking roles while maintaining positional awareness. Their value lies in adaptability, ball retention, and the ability to execute tactical instructions across multiple systems.

Kai Havertz occupies a hybrid role across midfield and attack, offering physical presence, off-ball movement, and aerial ability. His contributions often come through space creation and pressing rather than traditional playmaking, aligning with Arsenal’s emphasis on collective attacking patterns. His flexibility allows Arsenal to adjust attacking structures without significant tactical disruption.

In forward areas, Arsenal’s attacking depth includes players who can operate across multiple positions, enabling rotation and situational adjustments. These players support the team’s pressing intensity, maintain attacking width, and contribute to sustained pressure in the final third. Their roles are often defined by work rate, positional discipline, and execution within established attacking patterns rather than individual expression.

Collectively, Arsenal’s supporting players are integrated into Arteta’s system through clear role definition and tactical expectations. While they may not serve as the primary drivers of structure or tempo, their contributions are essential in maintaining system continuity across competitions, managing workload, and adapting to match-specific demands. This depth reinforces Arsenal’s ability to execute a consistent playing identity while remaining flexible and resilient over the course of a season.
