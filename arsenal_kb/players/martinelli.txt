Gabriel Martinelli is an attacking player for Arsenal whose profile adds directness, intensity, and vertical threat to Mikel Arteta’s system. Born on June 18, 2001, in Guarulhos, Brazil, Martinelli joined Arsenal in 2019 and has developed into a key contributor on the left side of the attack. His style complements Arsenal’s structured positional play by providing pace and aggression in advanced areas.

Martinelli typically operates as a left winger, where his primary responsibility is to threaten the opposition defensive line through runs in behind and direct ball progression. Unlike more possession-oriented attackers, his role emphasizes verticality and penetration, offering Arsenal an option to attack space quickly when defensive blocks are compact or when transitions occur.

In possession, Martinelli combines close control with explosive acceleration. He is comfortable receiving wide and driving directly at defenders, forcing defensive lines to retreat or commit. His movement off the ball is particularly important, as he frequently makes diagonal runs into the penalty area from wide positions, creating scoring opportunities and drawing defenders away from central attackers.

Within Arsenal’s positional framework, Martinelli’s aggressive movement is balanced by structured support around him. The left-sided full-back and midfielders adjust their positioning to ensure that Martinelli can take risks without compromising team shape. This allows Arsenal to maintain overall positional discipline while benefiting from his attacking unpredictability.

Defensively, Martinelli contributes through high-intensity pressing and recovery runs. He is often tasked with closing down opposition full-backs and applying pressure during Arsenal’s press, helping to lock play into wide areas. His work rate enables Arsenal to sustain pressing phases without exposing the left side defensively.

Martinelli’s development under Arteta reflects the manager’s emphasis on refining raw attributes within a tactical framework. While his game is based on speed and directness, his decision-making and positional awareness have improved over time, enabling him to operate more effectively within Arsenal’s controlled attacking structure.

Overall, Gabriel Martinelli provides Arsenal with a dynamic attacking dimension that contrasts with more possession-focused teammates. His ability to stretch defenses vertically, combined with his pressing intensity and growing tactical discipline, makes him a vital component of Arsenal’s attacking balance under Arteta.
